## Github Account

Follow the relevant instructions below to set up your GitHub account. Note that there is an annual cost for GitHub of around $180/year so if you are unsure if you actually need an account please discuss with your manager. Please keep anything work related under the Coanda org and not just as part of your personal account.

__If you do not have a GitHub account__
1. Go to github.com and create an account using the sign up button.
1. Use your tetratech.com email address (not your Coanda one).
1. Choose a username that will be recognizable to your colleagues. You could use something like your full name or the 5-character code like "swebs". You could use a prefix like "crd-" if the username you want is not available.
1. Change your display "name" to your full name in the user settings (public profile section).
1. Send an email or Teams chat with your username to Scott Webster or Tom Depew and we will invite your account to the Coanda organization.

1. Submit an IT helpdesk request for a "GitHub Enterprise Standalone" license (Helpdesk - Software/Applications - Request Software Install/Purchase). Your supervisor will be asked to approve. Let them know about the request and tell them to reach out to Scott Webster or Tom Depew if they have any questions.
